*Control the Snake:*
> Using either the arrow keys on your keyboard or by swiping on the
> touchscreen, take control of the snake and guide it through the game
> board. Remember, the snake moves continuously, so be careful not to
> let it collide with the walls or itself!

> To start a new game, simply press the "Enter" key on your keyboard or
> tap the "New Game" button on the screen. The snake will begin to move,
> and your objective is to navigate it towards the food items scattered
> across the board.

*Collect the Food:*

> As the snake moves, its length increases when it consumes the food.
> Aim to collect as much food as possible to grow the snake longer.
> However, be cautious not to let the snake collide with its own body,
> as it will result in game over!

*Pause and Resume:*

> Life can sometimes interrupt our gaming sessions. If you need to take
> a break or attend to other matters, you can pause the game by pressing
> the "Esc" key on your keyboard or tapping the "Pause" button. This
> way, you can seamlessly resume your gameplay later without losing your
> progress.

*Set High Scores:*

> Challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible. Each food
> item consumed contributes to your score. Try to surpass your previous
> records and climb the leaderboard! The game will remember your high
> score, even if you close your browser, ensuring that your
> accomplishments are always recognized.
