**How to Play:**
*Control the Snake:*
> Using either the arrow keys on your keyboard or by swiping on the

> let it collide with the walls or itself!

*Start a New Game:*

> To start a new game, simply press the "Enter" key on your keyboard or
> tap the "New Game" button on the screen. The snake will begin to move,

*Collect the Food:*

> As the snake moves, its length increases when it consumes the food.
> Aim to collect as much food as possible to grow the snake longer.
> However, be cautious not to let the snake collide with its own body,

> Life can sometimes interrupt our gaming sessions. If you need to take
> a break or attend to other matters, you can pause the game by pressing
> the "Esc" key on your keyboard or tapping the "Pause" button. This

> item consumed contributes to your score. Try to surpass your previous
> records and climb the leaderboard! The game will remember your high
> score, even if you close your browser, ensuring that your
> accomplishments are always recognized.
